  <h1> Users </h1>
<p>
House of 3 - Initially a whiteboard was bought in order to write down what food was purchased when in order to effecticely what our application is focused on. Quickly the whiteboard stopped being used and currently is unused at all. Currently the system the user uses is memory and checking the look and smell of the food. Waste is not common but happens around monthly. <br />
House of 4 - Buys a lot of food for household due to the number of people. There is no system for tracking food - esspecially produce. Food goes to waste due to the quanitity and amount of people. Household often has lots of waste. <br />
House of 1 - This user does employ any method other than memory. As this is one user in the house and largely only has to feed themself and is middle aged so is practiced in food management and very rarely has waste.
</p>

  <h1> Problem </h1>
<p>
The problem is that often food that is kept in a household will be forgotten, other food prioritiezes, and ultimately going to waste. This results in wasted food and in extreme cases a biohazard.   
<a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/tips-reduce-food-waste"> Here is a website talking about food waste. </a>
</p>

  <h1> Personas </h1>
  <h2>Healthy Eaters and Organic Focused People</h2>
  <p>
  Age: 18-64 <br />
  Race: Any <br />
  Pain Point: They buy lots of perishable foods which increases waste significantly. <br />
  Behaviors: They buy groceries, participate in CSAs, and other healthy food often. <br />
  Motivations: They want to save money and be friednly to the environment.
  </p>
  <h2>Multipeople Households</h2>
  <p>
  Age: 18-64 <br />
  Race: Any <br />
  Pain Point: Households that have many people will fluctuate food consumption significantly leading to more waste. <br />
  Behaviors: More people have more food leading to more waste as there is also more oversite. <br />
  Motivations: Often this is students, families, or partners who would also want to save money.
  </p>

  <h1>Use Cases</h1>
  <p>
A parent of the household goes shopping, purchases what the kids normally eat for breakfast and more; say yogurt, ceral, and milk among other groceries. The parent then logs the food into the application noting the food and date added which defaults to the current time and day. The week goes by and the children of the household eat the ceral, but are going through a phase where they don't want the yogurt. The yogurt is not only sealed in a container so cannot be easily checked visably but live in a drawer in the bottom of the fridge for ease of access from the children, for who the yogurt was bought. The yogurt is nearing the end of it's life and the application then reflects this, showing the yogurt as a high priority among other food. Because of this the yogurt is then consumed preventing food waste that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

  <h1>Related Products</h1>
<p>
<a href="https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep-food-safe/foodkeeper-app">The government provided application foodkeeper</a> - This application places reminders which are placed into the users calender which diversifies the location for reminders and forces the use of multiple applications and devices. It has diverse interests such as general food saftey and guides allowing for user confusion. <br />
<a href="http://kitchenpalapp.com/en/">This is an application for keeping food<a/> - This application uses a subscription based system which leads to food waste as loss of users over time.
</p>

<h1>Comparing Products</h1>
<p>This application is focused purely on food waste which means no distractions such as other guides, and calander reminders. This focus allows for increased awareness of food expiration optimizing food waste reduction. Often with households many people are working and have personal calanders allowing for external reminders to easily go unnoticed. Often there will not be as much personal bandwidth to learn a new app with many irrelevant features such as guides they would already know or annoucements and similar noise.</p>

  <h1>Feasibility</h1>
  <p>
  This project will likely be a cloud application so we will be able to work asynchronously. There will be a small database for food lifespan. This will take a few weeks to create. The application itself will need to recall inventory which will also take a few weeks to establish. Once these two are done the application will largely be human design which will take at least several weeks in order to polish and can be more time if available.
